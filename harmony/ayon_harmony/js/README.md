## Pype - ToonBoom Harmony integration

### Development

#### Setting up ESLint as linter for javascript code

You nee [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. All you need to do then
is to run:

```sh
npm install
```
in **js** directory. This will install eslint and all requirements locally.

In [Atom](https://atom.io/) it is enough to install [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/lintecr-eslint) and set global *npm* prefix in its settings.
