## Invalid product context

Folder path found '{found}' in products, expected '{expected}'.

### How to repair?

You can fix this with `Repair` button on the right. This will use '{expected}' folder path and overwrite '{found}' folder path in scene metadata.

After that restart `Publish` with a `Reload button`.

If this is unwanted, close workfile and open again, that way different folder value would be used for context information.

### __Detailed Info__ (optional)

This might happen if you are reuse old workfile and open it in different context.
(Eg. you created product "renderCompositingDefault" from folder "Robot' in "your_project_Robot_compositing.aep", now you opened this workfile in a context "Sloth" but existing product for "Robot" folder stayed in the workfile.)
